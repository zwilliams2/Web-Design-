<input type="text" id="myinput"><button id="thebutton">Click</button>

<p id="firstest"class="intro"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Have the children create or color different fish for the activity. Then the teacher will attach a paper clip and magnet to the fish and a magnet and string to the fishing rod.</p class="intro">
<p id="firstest" class="intro"><strong>Step 2:</strong> The children will then get into groups. Then, supervisors can explain to them what the game is and demonstrate how the game works. Then they can explain that the team that catches the most fish will receive a prize.</p class="intro">

<p id="firstest" class="intro"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Determine which group won and give them their prize, and play again if they want to.</p class="intro">

<h3>Summary:</h3>
Engaging in this activity not only fosters the enhancement of social and communication skills among individuals with autism spectrum disorder but also provides a structured environment for collaborative learning. By participating in group work, the children are encouraged to communicate effectively, a crucial aspect of their developmental journey. The interactive nature of the task, where they collaboratively aim to catch the most fish for a prize, compels the children to coordinate efforts, fostering teamwork and communication. Taking turns to reel in fish not only promotes patience but further contributes to the refinement of their social interactions.

Beyond the immediate social benefits, the activity instills a sense of camaraderie as the children cheer for their teams, creating a supportive atmosphere that encourages positive social engagement. Moreover, the necessity for the children to collectively decide on the order of turns amplifies their collaborative decision-making skills. This multifaceted approach to social development extends to the realm of fine motor skills, as the children are afforded the opportunity to express creativity by designing and coloring their own fish. In this way, the activity becomes a holistic platform, seamlessly integrating social, communicative, and fine motor skill development for individuals with autism spectrum disorder.
