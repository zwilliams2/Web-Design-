<h1> <strong> Dementia: </strong> The Insidious Condition </h1>
<p id="firsttest">Dementia is characterized by the loss of cognitive function in the brain. Disorientation in the areas of decision-making, reasoning, problem-solving, learning, and many other abilities is likely to become more distinguishable and prevalent. This can occur rapidly or slowly with regard to the severity of its spread in the individual. The typical targeted age group in which its commonness takes place is around sixty-five, though this can transpire before or later in life around the age of eighty-five. Though there are some treatments that can reduce its speed, there is no true cure for dementia following that of the symptoms that accompany it. While taking this into account, the troubles associated with dementia victims who have difficulty receiving the emotional and social help they need can influence the psychological, emotional, and social well-being of these individuals. Support, security, and trustworthiness are vital when ensuring the effectiveness of their care.
People who suffer from dementia should actively practice communication, especially as it pertains to the communication held amongst their caregiver.</p id="firsttest">
<p></p>This ensures that the patient's needs are being met. Having dementia means that there is a significant decrease in cognitive and physical operations, aforementioned, and with this in mind it is important to take this into account when considering the struggles that dementia patients have when communicating properly. With regards to cognitive function, I elaborate on the mental processes in how the brain dilutes information, how the brain stores memories, and how the brain learns new things. With regard to the physical, I state how their difficulty in functioning to walk or even stand up without falling. Physically and cognitively speaking, these effects are only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the damage dementia does to an individual. This magnifies the hassle for effective communication between the family, caregiver and patient. The combination of cognitive and physical challenges creates a complete display of the complications that the individuals who struggle with dementia experiences. 
Ackuncfunowledging the multifaceted being of these hardships underscores the significance of how important communication practices are. Caregivers play a major part in making this process simpler with them being able to use their styles of communication to serve the oncoming needs of the individuals with dementia. Benefits of this ability include: adaption, a sense of patience, empathy; transparency, and an understanding of the different physical and cognitive restrictions at play. The journey of communication with individuals suffering from dementia goes above the mere linguistic exchanges. As we journey our way to build an efficient quality of life for the individuals affected by dementia, communication practices should be prioritized because communication serves as a cornerstone in this entire attempt.
<p></p>
The effective care of individuals who have dementia is characterized based on the integration and fulfillment of their needs being met, emotionally, which ensures a sense of security within the relationship held amongst the patient and caregiver. Establishing security promotes a healthy bond based on safety, dependability, and relatability. With this, I emphasize the incorporation of the person-centered approach when tending to and caring for older individuals who have dementia. Professor Thomas Kitwood proposed the Social-Psychological Theory of Personhood in Dementia which drove the ideas pertaining to how to fulfill the needs of individuals with dementia. Kitwood emphasized that dementia patient&rsquo; needs are met through the assurance of their social environment, including the surrounding people within the environment. His theory drove the ideas communicated in the research article, Effects of Person-Centered Care at the Organizational Level for People with Dementia in which it has been presented that, “creating and strengthening a positive relationship with the person through warm and accepting human contact; communicating respectfully, valuing and honoring the person; treating the person as a sentient and unique human being by valuing their innate nature; assisting the person to retain their remaining strengths; viewing the person&rsquo; world from their own perspective; and enabling the person to feel socially confident and maintain emotional attachments (Chenoweth et al., 2019)” are the principles in which fulfilling the emotional needs of dementia patients, at the organizational level, can be achieved. 
</p> 
<p>Fusing these ideas into the approach taken when tending to dementia patients thereby requires the centering of relationships that are built on support, empowerment, and care. According to another research article, Meeting the Emotional Needs of Hospital Patients with Dementia: A Freelisting Study with Ward Staff, which analyzes dementia patients in hospital care, their emotional needs, and the responses of staff members when tending to the patients, “consistent with what staff prioritized in this study, accounts of hospital-care from patients with dementia and their families have established that relationships with care staff are of greater importance … (Coleston et al., 2018).” To support this, the researchers of this article conducted a study that involved interviewing forty-seven hospital staff members whose primary focus was providing dementia care. Their focuses involved: how to notice emotional distress, its causes, responses to emotional distress, and responses that are productive. Conclusions drawn from their study indicate effective feedback that can be implemented into care practices. This includes, reassurance; listed by 43% of patients, talking; listed by 45% of patients,  comfort: listed by 34% of patients, asking about their needs: listed by 32% of patients, listening: listed by 26% of patients, and many others. Within this study, responses that were found effective to the patients included, knowing the person; 40% named, talking; 43%, sitting with or being with; 40%, trying all of the responses listed; 28%, and reassurance; 26%. 
    <p></p> Statistics drawn from this study indicate that the integration and emotional fulfillment of the patient&rsquo; needs aids in a successful positive relationship between the caretaker and individual who has dementia. With that, “a coordinated and sustained cultural and structural transformation supporting PCC requires the healthcare service to focus on respectful and positive relationships between caregivers, people living with dementia and their families, improved capacity of caregivers to provide PCC through the development of knowledge and skills, supporting the dignity and autonomy of the person living with dementia, and promoting collaboration and teamwork in delivering care that aims for well-being (Chenoweth et al., 2018).” Understanding, addressing, and acknowledging the emotional needs of dementia patients alludes to an attentive, responsive, and compassionate care service. This indicates that the integration of what is necessary for the health, welfare, and maintenance of dementia patients including that of a person-centered care approach, are necessary when ensuring that older individuals with dementia emotional needs are met. I agree with the implications made of ensuring that the care received by staff members to the patients are consistent with what is being consistently delivered outside of the studies performed. With this being said, I consider the situations in which other factors that occur in the hospital setting can influence the attitudes of the care-staff. Consequently, I do not know if I fully agree with the reports found as it did not consider or observe the deep evaluation of the care described by the staff members, rather it solely focused on the specific methods in which responses were found to be most effective. 
<p></p>While being diagnosed with dementia may be bleak there are treatments for the condition, some more conventional than others. Medical science has experienced massive exponential growth within the last century and with that comes an incongruence between traditional treatments and their modern clinical counterparts. For example in the case of dementia there are a vast number of basic non-pharmacological methods to mitigate the symptoms of or limit the likelihood of developing the condition. The first of these being engaging in mentally stimulating activities, such as playing crossword puzzles or other games that challenge the mind. Aerobic activity is another such method, but this may pose a problem if the Pre-dementia or dementia having person possesses any mobility issues. The rest of the proposed non-pharmacological treatments are as follows: Social interaction, eating a healthy diet, adequate sleep, proper personal hygiene, adequate advanced medical care, long term health care planning, effective communication, and taking care of the person&rsquo; psychological health. 
While non-pharmacological intervention may be beneficial for mild dementia or dementia prevention, the current gold standard for treatment is pharmacological. This gold standard is also the line of treatment that often yields the highest degree of result. This result being a reduction in the main symptoms of the condition. These being, to quote from Dementia: What pharmacists need to know (Duong et al. 2017) “the cognitive deficits it causes can present as memory loss, communication and language impairments, agnosia (inability to recognize objects), apraxia (inability to perform previously learned tasks) and impaired executive function (reasoning, judgment and planning).”; the main goal of all medications for dementia being to reduce the occurrence of symptoms that could fit within these categories. The first of these inventions I will be covering is donepezil. It is available in dosages of 5-10 milligrams as either a standard tablet or an orally disintegrating tablet. donepezil falls into the class of drugs known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, they function by limiting the amount of a specific enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This in turn leads to heightened memory function, as well as executive function due to the fact that acetylcholine is heavily implicated in memory and the function thereof. There are two other medications that also fall squarely into this category, those being rivastigmine and galantamine. <p></p> These two compounds are often used in cases where the dementia is less extreme or still in its early stages, whereas donepezil is approved for use even in end stage cases of dementia. Another commonly prescribed medication, albeit of another class is Memantine. This compound is an NMDA receptor antagonist, which just so happens to be the same class of drugs as ketamine. It exerts its therapeutic effect based on the theory that dementia is caused by an overactivation of glutamate, a primary excitatory neurotransmitter. A way to decrease this excitation is to antagonize the NMDA receptors, which in turn reduces the overall amount of glutamate, leading to the aforementioned therapeutic effect. All of these medications serve as standard treatments for dementia but there also exist some experimental therapies. For example allopregnanolone, which is a naturally occurring neurosteroid, has been shown to be potentially effective as a treatment for Alzheimer's, and could also be an effective treatment for dementia.  
Regarding the information that I, Johnny, have found, I find the facts listed from the World Health Organization to be the most reliable of all the information. Its credibility is not only arrived at from the name of the source, but, the details listed speak on all aspects of dementia including: reasons how and why someone would get this condition, treatment methods, and self-care. Furthermore, all of the other information I have found has assisted in my research process as my inquiry has led to focuses that also vary in support groups whose main focus is the assistance of individuals with dementia to the extra assistance needed when taking care of the patients. 
Dementia has a profound impact on not only the individual who has the condition but the family and caregivers. Ensuring a strong support system, administering effective medications, exploring the finest treatment methods, and displaying effective care approaches, both emotionally and socially, to ensure that the needs of the individual are being met aid in a more comforting process whereby the individual and their family are best suited. </p>
